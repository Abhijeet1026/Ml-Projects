This file contains information about all the machine learning projects.

1. Personalized cancer diagnosis
 A Machine learning Case Study to detect type of mutation in a gene using gene, variation, and text.
- Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.
- In this case study, we need to find the type of the mutation gene, given variation, some text data, and 
  gene from public research.
- Performed univariate analysis, data cleaning then converted text to vector using TFIDF.
- Finally predicted the mutation by training 3k points and reduced log loss from 2.554 to 0.96

2.Social Network Graph Link Prediction
A Machine Learning case study to predict links in a social graph to recommend 
friends/connections/followers.
- Engineered 30 graph features.
- Trained Random forest and XGBOOST Models.
- Achieved the highest F1-Score using of 0.926.

3. Quora Question Pair Similarity Problem
The Objective of the Project was to identify which questions asked on Quora are duplicates of questions that have already been asked.
- Used approximately 300k  questions pair dataset.
- Used extensive natural language processing to preprocess the question.
- Trained logistic regression, linear SVM and XGBOOST models.
- Reduced the test log-loss from 0.88 to 0.34.
- Best Performing model is XGBOOST.
